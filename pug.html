       <p>The pug is a breed of dog originally from China, with physically distinctive features of a wrinkly, short-muzzled face and curled tail.
        The breed has a fine, glossy coat that comes in a variety of colors, most often light brown (fawn) or black, and a compact, square body
        with well-developed muscles. Pugs were brought from China to Europe in the sixteenth century and were popularized in Western Europe by 
        the House of Orange of the Netherlands, and the House of Stuart. In the United Kingdom, in the nineteenth century, 
        Queen Victoria developed a passion for pugs which she passed on to other members of the Royal family. Pugs are known for being sociable 
        and gentle companion dogs.</p>
