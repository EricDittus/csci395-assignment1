        <h2>My hobbies</h2>
        <p>I like to play video games, read textbooks, watch movies and go outside.</p>
        <p>When I graduate from college I want to work at Google and become a software engineer or data scientist.</p>
        <p>I grew up in Manhattan and I have been here for 22 years. Hopefully, I can stay longer. </p>
