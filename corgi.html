    <h2>The Pembroke Welsh Corgi dates back to the 12th century, and is the
      preffered dog breed of Queen Elizabeth II, who has thus far had 30 Corgis
      during her reign. The Corgi was said to have come from two childrem who
      chanced upon a group of Fairies mourning the death of their friend in the forest.
      To thank them for their consolation, the Fairies gifted the children two Corgi pups. </h2>
