	<h1><strong>Golden Retrievers</strong></h1>
	<p>Golden retrievers originated in Scotland. They were cross-bred by Sir
    Dudley Majoribanks in the 19th century. He used flat-coated retrievers
    and tweed water spaniels (along with other species). Golden 
    retrievers are a medium-sized breed of dog and they are one of the most
    kept pets in the Western countries. They are generally very friendly and
    calm, making them easy to train. Their average lifespan is of 12-13 years. 
    Their friendly and calm nature makes them a popular pet among families 
    with kids, but who wouldn't like them regardless of age!
